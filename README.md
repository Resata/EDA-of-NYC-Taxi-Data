### 🚕 Automatidata – NYC Taxi Trip Analysis (Course 3)
A structured exploratory analysis of NYC Yellow Taxi data completed as part of Course 3: Go Beyond the Numbers in the Google Advanced Data Analytics program.

This project focuses on using Python for EDA, uncovering patterns in rides, fares, tips, passenger behavior, and location activity, and translating findings into meaningful insights.


###📌 Project Objectives
* Assess and clean taxi trip data


* Explore fare, distance, and tip distributions


* Identify data quality issues and outliers


* Analyze temporal and location-based trends


* Summarize insights to support operational decision-making



### 🧰 Technologies Used
* Python 3


* pandas, NumPy


* matplotlib, seaborn


* Jupyter Notebook



📊 Key Insights
* The dataset contains several invalid values (e.g., negative fares, zero-passenger trips).


* Fare and total amount distributions include extreme outliers, suggesting data entry issues or exceptional trips.


* Most rides are short-distance, typically between 1–3 miles.


* Temporal patterns reveal slight variation in ride volume across weekdays and months.


* Location-based analysis highlights common drop-off points and unusual distribution gaps caused by numeric category spacing.
